# Skiffin

Provides who's in and who's out information for The Skiff.

## TODO

* Add persistence backend (it's all in memory for now)
* Deploy to Heuroku
* Add a UI
* Think about security - the end points are open to all
* Wire up to 4sq?
* Wire up to RFID and put reading in the door
* Add location (WERKS or SKIFF)


## Running

This is a Lift web app.  

    $ ./sbt
    sbt> container:start

Then `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`


## API v1

All urls prefixed with `/api/v1` (apologies to REST purists)

### Get a list of everyone

	GET /api/vi/people

E.g.,

    curl -v -X GET -H 'Content-type: text/json' http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/people

      "count":2,
      "people":

          "when":1326562010157
        },
